# n5GDHC_sim

This repository provides the Modelica implementation of a fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) network, inspired by the network in Gutach-Bleibach, Germany.

-------------
The simulation of the model was tested with OpenModelica 1.25.0 and Modelica Standard Library 4.0.0.
